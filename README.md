# My Py Algorithms

## About The Project

This project, `my-py-algorithms`, is a comprehensive study and implementation of various algorithms using Python. It is structured to cover fundamental algorithms chapter-wise, facilitating a step-by-step learning approach. Each chapter focuses on a specific category of algorithms, ranging from basic search and sort algorithms to more complex algorithms like merge sort, quick sort, and graph search algorithms.

## Getting Started

This section should guide users and contributors on how to install, setup, and run your project. Provide clear and precise steps to get the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- Poetry for dependency management

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/simultechnology/my-py-algorithms.git
   ```
2. Install the project dependencies using Poetry
   ```sh
   cd my-py-algorithms
   poetry install
   ```

### Usage

For each algorithm, navigate to its respective directory under `src/my_py_algorithms` and run the Python file. For example, to run the binary search algorithm:

```sh 
python src/my_py_algorithms/ch1/binary_search.py
```

### Running Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system. Include details about what the tests cover and any special cases.

```sh 
poetry run pytest
```

### Contributing

Encourage contributions and outline the process for submitting pull requests to you.

### License
